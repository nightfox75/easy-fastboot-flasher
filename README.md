# INSTALLATION
1. Unlock your devices bootloader. You can find out how to do it here: https://source.android.com/docs/setup/build/running, under "Unlocking the bootloader";
2. Install Google's USB Driver. You can download it from here: https://dl.google.com/android/repository/usb_driver_r13-windows.zip;
3. Reboot your device into fastboot mode. There are different ways to do this. You can find this information on Google for your device.

# TROUBLESHOOTING
- If you see the text "waiting-for-device", but you've already connected your device, try to reconnect it, check if your device in fastboot mode and USB driver is installed and ready to use.
- If your commands have been skipped by the program, that means you've not selected file for flashing. Check is that right.
- If some functions is not working, Platform Tools is not responding or program (or Platform Tools) has been crashed - inform me about that in Issues tab using tag "bug".
